README
    This project requires the Wt (Witty) webtool kit library. 
    To build and install this library, cd to wt-4.8.2/build and enter the following commands:
        $ make
        $ make install
    Full instructions can be found at https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/InstallationUnix.html

    This project was built and compiled on a Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04.1) for prototyping. 
    Final deployment will be compiled on a Raspberry Pi.

    To run the main application (login testing and shows main landing page), cd to the root directory (group34) and enter:
        $ make
        $ ./Assistant --docroot docroot  --approot approot --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 9090
    and head to the local host ip address in any browser (127.0.0.1:9090).

    Before restarting the main application after a compile, enter:
        $ fuser -k 9090/tcp
    to kill the web process.

    CALCULATOR
    To compile and run the calculator use:
        $ make Calculator
        $ ./Calculator
    
    It will prompt you through command line to enter a number, choose an operation, then another number. User can exit the calculator by choosing 8 for the operation (as shown in the operation list) or by cancelling the program with CTRL+C

    PROFILE CREATION, REMOVING, AND USER OBJECTS
    To compile and run the profile creator use:
        $ make Profiles
        $ ./Profiles

    Since this is just the foundations for the back-end of profile management, there is no interactable prototype. In the Test.cpp which the executable "Profiles" uses, several profiles are created with certain passwords and usernames, then displayed, then one is removed, and the program tries to display them again, showing the profiles adding, removing, and displaying capabilities.
