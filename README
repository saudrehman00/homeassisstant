README
    This project requires the Wt (Witty) webtool kit library. 
    To build and install this library, cd to wt-4.8.2/build and enter the following commands:
        $ make
        $ make install
    Full instructions can be found at https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/InstallationUnix.html

    This project was built and compiled on a Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04.1) for prototyping. 
    Final deployment will be compiled on a Raspberry Pi.

    To run the main application (login testing and shows main landing page), cd to the root directory (group34) and enter:
        $ make
        $ ./Assistant --docroot docroot  --approot approot --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 9090
    and head to the local host ip address in any browser (127.0.0.1:9090).

    Before restarting the main application after a compile, enter:
        $ fuser -k 9090/tcp
    to kill the web process.
