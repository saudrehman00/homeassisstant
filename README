README
    This project was built and compiled on a Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04.1) for prototyping. 
    Final deployment will be compiled on a Raspberry Pi.
    
    This project requires the Wt (Witty) webtool kit, Boost, Cmake, and Curlpp libraries.
    Enter the following commands to check if you can install the Boost and Curlpp libraries from command line:
        $ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
        $ sudo apt-get install libcurlpp-dev
        $ sudo apt-get install cmake
    Otherwise, manual installation is required:
    https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/more/getting_started/index.html
    http://www.curlpp.org/
    https://cmake.org/install/

    To build and install the Wt library, cd to wt-4.8.2/build and enter the following commands:
        $ make
        $ make install
    Full instructions can be found at https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt/doc/reference/html/InstallationUnix.html

    
    For this prototype, there are components which have not yet been integrated into the main graphical interface.
    For ease of use, there are several files which can be individually ran and tested for their functionalities.

    For user stories related to querying from data APIs, the related files will be found in the 'web' directory.
    To compile the program, enter 
        $ make
    and run the file named 'test'.

    To run the main application (login testing, logging, main landing page, and list creations), cd to the root directory (group34) and enter:
        $ make
        $ ./Assistant --docroot docroot  --approot approot --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 9090
    Afterwards, head to the local host ip address in any browser (127.0.0.1:9090). Other features have not been implemented.

    Before restarting the main application after a compile, enter:
        $ fuser -k 9090/tcp
    to kill the web process.
